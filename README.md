# DustDuinoPlus
First Commit for the Sensor Day

This project builds upon the DustDuino project (Matthew Schroyer; https://github.com/NodeJournalism/DustDuino/blob/master/DustDuino.ino).
The network communication is handled differently (this project uses an Adafruit WIFI shield), it adds temperature and humidity and
the server protocol is UltraLight 2.0, so it can be used with FI-WARE IOT servers.
